## Windows 95 is stuck in a bad state

Restart the application and click on the "Reset machine & delete state" button.
You can find it in the lower left of the screen. Then, hit the "Start Windows 95"
button to start your virtual machine again.

## I want to install additional apps or games

If you are running Windows 10, macOS, or Linux, you can probably "mount" the
virtual hard drive used by `windows95` to add files. Hit the "Show Disk Image"
button in the lower right of the app, which will take you to the disk image.
On both Windows 10 and macOS, double-click the disk image to open it.

On Linux, search the Internet for instructions on how to mount an `img` disk
image on your distribution.
