# windows95

This is Windows 95, running in an Electron app. Yes, it's the full thing. I'm sorry.

## Does it work?
Yes! Quite well, actually.

## Should this have been a native app?
Absolutely.

## Does it run Doom (or my other favorite game)?
You'll likely be better off with an actual virtualization app, but the short answer is yes. [Thanks to
@DisplacedGamers](https://youtu.be/xDXqmdFxofM) I can recommend that you switch to a resolution of
640x480 @ 256 colors before starting DOS games - just like in the good ol' days.

## How's the code?
This only works well by accident and was mostly a joke. The code quality is accordingly.

Before you can run this from source, you'll need the disk image. It's not part of the
repository, but you can grab it using the `Show Disk Image` button from the packaged
release, which does include the disk image.

Unpack the `images` folder into the `src` folder, creating this layout:

```
./src/images/windows95.img
```

Once you've done so, run `npm install` and `npm start` to run your local build.
